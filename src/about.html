            <p>Mineocity Hosting was started in 2011 as a brand of Minecraft Server Hosting that to put it simply was
                intended to be simple.</p>

            <p>Since 2011 we have grown at an astonishing rate that has allowed us to create partnerships to benefit the
                customers who realize how great we are at what we do.</p>

            <p>We know what its like to run servers when the server you rent lag. We know that lag takes the fun out of
                gaming so we have built our system to remove all types of lag that we can.</p>
