            	Mineocity Hosting was started in 2011 with the sole purpose of providing high-quality, but easy to use Minecraft server hosting.
            	We have developed many custom features that are exclusive for our customers.
            	We aim to make our customer experience as enjoyable as possible.
            	<br>
            	We know what its like to run servers and proceed to seem them lag even though you were promised they wouldn't.
            	We know that lag takes the fun out of gaming so we have built our geographically diverse system to remove as much latency and lag out of the network.
            </p>

            <p>
            	Since 2011 we have grown at an astonishing rate and have formed partnerships that directly benefit our customers.
            	These partnerships provide our customers with discounts or free service with the premier 3rd party products related to Minecraft.
            </p>

            <p>
            	As a division of Ocity Hosting LLC we have access to premier datacenters around the globe and can offer direct control over our
            	product from the network to every piece of RAM in the servers. Our servers are built exclusively with enterprise-grade hardware
            	from manufacturers such as SuperMicro, Intel, and Hynix.
